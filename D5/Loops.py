###### Loops in Python ########
### while loop
### for loop

## while loop
# count = 0
# while count < 5:
#  print("hello", count)
#  count = count + 1

## Q1) Print numbers from 1 to 100
# count =1 
# while count<=100:
#     print(count)
#     count = count + 1

## Q2) Print the multiples table of 'n' 
# n = int(input("Enter the number : "))
# count = 1
# while count <= 10:
#     print(n ,"*", count ,"=",n*count)
#     count = count + 1 

## Q3) Print the numbers from 1 to 100 which are divisible by 'n'
# n = int(input("Enter the number : "))
# count = 1
# while count <= 100:
#    count = count + 1
#    if(count % n == 0):
#        print(count)
## Q4) Print the elements of the following list using a loop:
##[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81,100]
# n = 1
# while n <= 10:
#     print(n*n)
#     n = n + 1

## Q5)   Search for a number x in this tuple using loop: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81,100]
